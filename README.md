# discordbot-rust
It's a discord bot, written in Rust. It's made up of two parts, [interactions](interactions/README.md) and [bot](bot/README.md). `interactions` handles all the user's interactions through Application commands (Slash commands, button presses, etc) and `bot` handles all of the tasks that require an active connection to Discord (joins, parts, messages, etc).
